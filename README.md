## Getting started

Simply clone the project, and run:

```bash
yarn install && yarn build && yarn storybook
```
- Note: yarn storybook helps you to visualize the components.

## Writing stories

The repo uses Storybook 7 and as such uses the general recommendations for writing stories. You can read more about it [here](https://storybook.js.org/docs/react/writing-stories/introduction)
